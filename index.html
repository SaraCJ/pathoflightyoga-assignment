<!—When working with css sheet, this looked very different from what it looks like in the examples in the textbook, not sure if that means I did it right or wrong but this version looks better than the one in the css file in the textbook. - Sara

<!— I also just noticed that in my first submission, I already went ahead and did chapters 5-7 for the chap 1-4 assignment, so I'm just going to reupload it again. Sorry for the confusion. If you want me to resubmit the chap 1-4 with the first version just let me know.
